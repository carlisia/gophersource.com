Kubernetes orchestrates scheduling and running applications that have been containerized,
usually with Docker. It provides all the "cloudy things" that developers expect
such as ensuring that your applications are running 24/7, dynamically provisioning
file volumes or databases, routing traffic to the
containers, etc.

There are _many, many_ areas where you can contribute to Kubernetes, and we need
people of all experience levels and backgrounds, not just senior developers,
to help out. The [contributor website](https://contributor.kubernetes.io) has
more information on where you can jump in, there is much more to Kubernetes
than just the scary sounding "core". üëç
