The Go community is renown for its cute gophers and friendly figureheads, but
can still be a confusing and intimidating area to jump into for new and
experienced gophers alike. I am asked quite regularly how someone can get into
open source, learn go, or influence the decisions made by the Go team.

  **I love the Go community, but I am not content with it.<br/>GopherSource is my attempt
  to pay it back the Go community.**

I  want to make Go better by providing a welcoming entry point into contributing
to upstream Go and open-source Go projects. My goal is to not only point out great
projects to contribute to, but to collaborate with those projects and fostering inclusive
communities. Communities where people feel safe joining in, and have a clear path on how to
become productive community members.
