1. Before you can contribute to Go projects, you will need a working Go development
    environment. The [setup guide](/setup) will walk you through installing and
    configuring Go.
1. [Connect with the community](/community/#chat)! A good place to see what's going on in a project,
    meet other contributors, and ask specific questions about a project.
    It's okay to lurk at first and get a feel for how things work before participating.
1. Drop in on the [Go Study Group](/study-group). This is a safe space for anyone
    interested in Go to meet community shepherds, ask questions or even request
    help learning a new topic, and start making connections with other people
    in the community.
1. Decide where you would like to start contributing. We have a
    [curated list of projects](/projects) that go out of their way to welcome
    new contributors.

Don't worry, **you are not alone**! Reach out to the community shepherds in the
[#gophersource channel on the Gophers Slack](https://gophers.slack.com/app_redirect?channel=gophersource)
and we can provide guidance and a bit of reassurance that you are in the right place. ‚ù§Ô∏è
