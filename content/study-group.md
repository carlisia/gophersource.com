Everyone is welcome to join the study group! Please join the **#gostudygroup** channel in the [Gophers slack](/community/#chat) for updates. Most topics are suitable for people
of all levels of Go experience.

See our [agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16m99AvcTL_BJOIbR4jkUDSHyApYUDb0VgC9UPBJMed0)
to get a feel for past activities or to propose a topic for an upcoming session.

The study group is a great way to not only _lurk 'n learn_ Go, but meet other people in the
community!

"Go Study Group - India" is an offshoot of the "Go Study Group" with an aim to engage gophers in India. It is open to everyone around the world. All communication takes place in English. The `India` session does not overlap with the `Go Study Group` US session, so, you can participate in both!

Go Study Group - India is independently managed and run by volunteers in India.
The agenda, proposals, and discussions are all managed on the GolangIndia [StudyGroup](https://github.com/golangindia/StudyGroup/) repo on Github. You'll also find the latest updates in the README.

Videos from our past sessions are available on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ3tfDfrAZYtuIclbgETFyQ)
