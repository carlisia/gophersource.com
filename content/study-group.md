Everyone is welcome to join the study group! Please join the **#gostudygroup** channel in the [Gophers slack](/community/#chat) for updates. Most topics are suitable for people
of all levels of Go experience.

See our [agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16m99AvcTL_BJOIbR4jkUDSHyApYUDb0VgC9UPBJMed0)
to get a feel for past activities or to propose a topic for an upcoming session.

The study group is a great way to not only _lurk 'n learn_ Go, but meet other people in the
community!
