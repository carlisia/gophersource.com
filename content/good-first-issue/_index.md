title: Good First Issue Brigade
description: |
  These issues aren't going to label themselves, it's going to take ... a brigade
  of gophers.
---

github has default labels "good first issue" and "help wanted".
the collective encourages people to look for these issues
some projects, like k8s, have guidelines on what issues qualify for these labels

but everything overlooks that it takes TIME, EFFORT and CONSTANT GARDENING to keep
a set of issues in the repositories that you maintain ready at all times for
contributors to look for.

I want to help maintainers with a few things

* tips on what makes a good first issue, or help wanted issue
* normalizing across multiple communities carving out the time for our maintainers
 to do the bit of gardening to turn regular old issues into good first issues
* help set expectations on how to deal with common scenarios that arrise with these
issue labels
  * how to claim an issue
  * how to put down an issue
  * how to ping about an issue that hasn't had progress
  * how to take back an issue that needs to be done now
  * how to ask to take over an issue that hasn't had progress (another contributor)
  * how to link to your good first issues and help wanteds
